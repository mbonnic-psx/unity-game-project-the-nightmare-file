 ## What I Worked On

| Area | Contribution |
|------|---------------|
| Gameplay Programming | Scripted player movement, interaction, and event triggers in Unity using C#. |
| Level & Narrative Design | Designed liminal environments and pacing to build tension and unease through environmental storytelling. |
| 3D Art & Assets | Modeled low-poly props and architectural elements in Blender, using PS1-style texture mapping and lighting. |
| Visual Effects | Used CRT distortion, and VHS post-processing for retro horror atmosphere. |
| Sound & Music | Designed ambient loops, distorted effects, and timing-based jump-scares using FL Studio. |
| Production | Managed full development pipeline, including optimization, packaging, and release on itch.io. |
