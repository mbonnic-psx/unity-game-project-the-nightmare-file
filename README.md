## Overview

- A PS1-style survival horror game set in a retro diner. You’re trapped inside with a killer on the loose. Explore, hide, survive do what every you have to do to make it to the end of the night.

- This project showcases my work in **gameplay programming, atmosphere design, and retro rendering techniques** developed as part of an **independent solo horror project**.

## Features

- **Core Mechanics:** Exploration, survival horror tension, and task completion
- **Visual-Style:** PS1-inspired low-poly models, PS1 Pixelation, Texture Warping
- **Technical Systems:**
  - Modular raycast system
  - Triggered events and scares
  - Small Animated sequences and scares

 ## What I Worked On

| Area | Contribution |
|------|---------------|
| Gameplay Programming | Scripted player movement, interaction, and event triggers in Unity using C#. |
| Level & Narrative Design | Designed liminal environments and pacing to build tension and unease through environmental storytelling. |
| 3D Art & Assets | Modeled low-poly props and architectural elements in Blender, using PS1-style texture mapping and lighting. |
| Visual Effects | Used CRT distortion, and VHS post-processing for retro horror atmosphere. |
| Sound & Music | Designed ambient loops, distorted effects, and timing-based jump-scares using FL Studio. |
| Production | Managed full development pipeline, including optimization, packaging, and release on itch.io. |
